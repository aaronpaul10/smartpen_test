# Smart Pension test

## Getting started

First, clone the repository. 

`bundle install`

## Usage

1. cd into the library

2. run the following command:

```
./exe/log_parser "/log_parser/spec/fixtures/webserver.log"
```

This will then return:

```
Page paths ordered by total hits:
/about/2 90 total visits
/contact 89 total visits
/index 82 total visits
/about 81 total visits
/help_page/1 80 total visits
/home 78 total visits

Page paths ordered by unique visits:
/help_page/1 23 unique visits
/contact 23 unique visits
/home 23 unique visits
/index 23 unique visits
/about/2 22 unique visits
/about 21 unique visits
```

## Approach

1. After reading through the requirements of the test, I made a simple UML diagram that tracks how data is retrieved and transformed to meet the test requirements. 

2. After sketching out a viable UML diagram (with SOLID principle driving the design) and figuring out the right abstractions needed, I then started coding.

3. Once the abstractions and the overall functionality of the application was developed, LogParser::Parser was then created to piece everything together. 

4. A simple executable was then created. It extracts the file path from the commandline argument, calling LogParser::Parser with the file path as an argument and
prints the data extracted from the file in a sorted (descending) order.  

## Readability

I've named all the classes as self-descriptive as possible. Method names are concise for both the modules and the tests.

## Time Complexity

The application runs at least O(3n) as we loop through the data 5 times, each with O(n) time complexity:

* LogParser::Reader breaking each line of the log file.
* LogParser::Tokenizer tokenizing the data.
* LogParser::Aggregator counting views and unique ips for each path.

## Improvements

* A more robust validation. The application, as of writing, only cares about 2 things: That the input file exists, and that it is accessible. 
* Commandline `--help` to describe usage.
* If runtime is of great importance, we can use something like Elasticsearch to aggregate, analyze and create visualizations with our weblogs.
* Extendable to accept and/or output different kinds of file formats with minimal costs.


## Code Coverage

`Coverage report generated for RSpec to /Users/aaron/RubyProjects/smartpen_project/log_parser/coverage. 82 / 82 LOC (100.0%) covered.`

A full test suite with 100.0% coverage is in `/spec`. Run `rspec` on the commandline for more information.
